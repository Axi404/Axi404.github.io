    summary: |
      As the leader of the vision team, I organized and led the team to build the visual framework, implement algorithms, deploy, and maintain them. I undertook the main responsibilities in the project. I collaborated with the mechanical and electrical control teams and led the team to win the first prize nationwide for building a robot from scratch.

      During the project, my responsibilities included:
      - Detecting targets using both traditional vision methods and deep learning.
      - Implementing target tracking using filtering algorithms(e.g., EKF).
      - Debugging and developing SLAM programs based on ROS for autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance.
      - Development using Linux systems.
